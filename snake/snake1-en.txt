We reuse the first minimalist snake game and now we organise a
little bit the code in order to make further evolutions more easy to
be added.

We create a data structure "game_state" where all the elements of
the game are together.

All the operations in charge of updating the state of the game
are grouped together in the procedure "update_state".

A new feature "game_over" occurs when the snake goes outside of the
window.
